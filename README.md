# Dockerfiles
Dockerfiles and stuffs to create Docker container images from apps with a lot of dependencies to run on my Arch Linux.

Each Dockerfile has the command at the top for running it in your desktop.

All of these live on dockerhub under [platao](https://hub.docker.com/u/platao/).

The Dockerfiles were get and adapted from many people:
* @ellerbrock: Chromium *57*, GIMP, LibreOffice
* @gianarb: Inkscape
* @lmm-git: Firefox *52.5*
* @fgrehm: Firefox *54*
* @itatabitovski: Franz
* @jessfraz: Atom, Audacity, Firefox *Quantum*, Slack

Thanks for all folks for your hard work!
