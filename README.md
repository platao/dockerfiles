# Dockerfiles
Dockerfiles collection to build images from apps with a lot of dependencies to run on Arch Linux KDE.

The Dockerfiles were got and adapted from many people:
* https://github.com/gianarb/dockerfile/ (Inkscape)
* https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles (GIMP)

Thanks for all these for your hard work!
