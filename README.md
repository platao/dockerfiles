# Dockerfiles
Dockerfiles and stuffs to create Docker container images from apps with a lot of dependencies to run on my Arch Linux.

Each Dockerfile has the command at the top for running it in your desktop.

All of these live on dockerhub under [platao](https://hub.docker.com/u/platao/).

The Dockerfiles were get and adapted from many people:
* @gianarb (Inkscape)
* @jessfraz (Audacity, Firefox *Quantum*, GIMP, Slack)
* @fgrehm (Firefox v54)

Thanks for all folks for your hard work!
